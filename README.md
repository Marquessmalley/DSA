# Data Structures & Algorithms

A hands-on course for learning Data Structures and Algorithms from the ground up.

## 🎯 What This Course Covers

- **Foundational thinking** — Understanding how to analyze and compare solutions
- **Core data structures** — Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables
- **Essential algorithms** — Searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming
- **Problem-solving patterns** — Recognizing and applying common techniques

## 📚 Course Structure

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| [Phase 0](./phase-0/) | Absolute Foundations — What is DSA, Big-O intuition, arrays, basic searching |

## 💡 Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

1. **Understanding over memorization** — Know *why* something works, not just *how*
2. **Trade-off thinking** — There's rarely a "perfect" solution, only trade-offs
3. **Incremental complexity** — Build intuition before formalism

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with [Phase 0](./phase-0/) to build the mental models you'll need for everything else.
